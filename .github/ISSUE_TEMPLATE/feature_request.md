Please read this!

Use this issue template for suggesting new features or updates to existing features.

The first three sections: "Problem to solve", "Intended users" and "Proposal", are strongly recommended,
while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the problem validation or breakdown phase.
However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate
the problem and start working on a solution.

This and other comments should be removed as you fill out the template

## Problem to solve

<!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, "As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value)." -->

## Intended users

<!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: 
 * types of users (e.g. Developer)

## What does success look like, and how can we measure that?
